The app is almost ready to be shipped on the App Store.


# The Hat Game

The hatGame is an iOS app to play the HatGame with friends. You can find a desciption of the rules here: https://www.activityvillage.co.uk/the-hat-game

It was for me an occasion to develop my skills using UIKit, Core data, Diffables datasources, several patterns (the app is a mix of MVC and MVVM).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need a mac with Xcode 11+ installed on it. 

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/jean-ben-guigui/TheHatGame.git
```

Then open The Hat Game.xcodeproj with Xcode.

To run the project use Command + R.

You can now play the hat game ðŸ¥³!

## Running the tests

You can run the tests using Command + U.

### Unit tests

For the moment the project only have unit tests. I'll implement better test coverage as well as integration tests pretty soon.
