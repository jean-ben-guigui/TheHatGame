The hatGame is an iOS app to play the HatGame with friends. You can find a desciption of the rules here: https://www.activityvillage.co.uk/the-hat-game

It was for me an occasion to develop my skills using UIKit, Core data, Diffables datasources, several patterns (the app is mainly in MVC, and one view controller is using MVVM as I considered it could benefit from it).

The app is almost ready to be shipped on the App Store.
